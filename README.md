# ACF Bulk Image Uploader

A WordPress plugin that streamlines the process of uploading multiple images to ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) image fields on your pages. Save time by bulk uploading images instead of manually adding them one by one through the page editor.

## Features

### ðŸš€ Core Functionality
- **Bulk Image Upload**: Select multiple images from the WordPress Media Library and automatically assign them to ACF fields
- **Smart Field Detection**: Automatically detects all ACF image fields on any selected page
- **Selective Field Assignment**: Choose which specific fields to populate using checkboxes
- **Field Statistics**: View image field counts (empty/total) for all pages directly in the dropdown
- **Replace/Skip Mode**: Option to replace existing images or only fill empty fields

### ðŸ“Š Supported ACF Field Types
- Single Image fields
- Gallery fields (accepts multiple images)
- Repeater fields with image sub-fields
- Flexible Content fields with image sub-fields
- Group fields containing image fields

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Assignment Features
- **Sequential Assignment**: Images are assigned to fields in order
- **Skip Specific Fields**: Uncheck fields you want to skip (e.g., skip fields 4, 5, 6 but fill 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10)
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time indicators showing which fields will receive images
- **Mismatch Warnings**: Alerts when image count doesn't match selected field count

## Troubleshooting

### No fields detected
- Ensure the selected page has ACF field groups assigned
- Check that field groups contain image-type fields
- Verify ACF is activated and working properly

### Images not uploading
- Check file permissions on uploads directory
- Verify images are valid and not corrupted
- Ensure you have proper WordPress capabilities

### Field counts not updating
- Click "Refresh Stats" button
- Statistics are cached for 5 minutes for performance
- Clear browser cache if issues persist

## Performance Notes

- Page statistics are cached for 5 minutes to improve performance
- Large sites with many pages may take a moment to load initially
- Batch processing ensures efficient database updates
